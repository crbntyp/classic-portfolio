        <span>With over 2 decades of experience in design and development, I've built a unique skill set that spans visual creativity, technical execution, and now.... I am now fully focused on integrating my collective experience into the field of artificial intelligence.</span> My early background in design laid a strong foundation in visual communication, typography, layout, and UX thinking. As I evolved, I leveraged those design sensibilities into interactive, API-powered JavaScript applications, managing full-stack flows, creating robust frontend experiences, and integrating backend solutions to deliver complex digital solutions.

        Recently, I've embraced the frontier of artificial intelligence and creative technology, combining digital art with code, and blending human-driven creativity with AI tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, Claude and Firefly. This hybrid of art, code, and AI positions me at the cutting edge of what creativity looks like in the modern age — not just building apps, but exploring how machines and humans collaborate to produce expressive work.

      <p>As an autodidact, I value curiosity, discipline, and intellectual independence — qualities that enable me to stay ahead of trends and approach challenges with innovative solutions.</p>
