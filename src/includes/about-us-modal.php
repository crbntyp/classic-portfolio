        With over 2 decade of experience in design and development, I've built a unique skill set that spans visual creativity, technical execution, and innovative AI-driven workflows. My early background in design laid a strong foundation in visual communication, typography, layout, and UX thinking. As you evolved, you leveraged those design sensibilities into interactive, API-powered JavaScript applications, managing full-stack flows, creating robust frontend experiences, and integrating backend services to deliver complex digital solutions.

        Recently, I've embraced the frontier of artificial intelligence and creative technology, combining digital art with code, and blending human-driven creativity with AI tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, Claude and Firefly. This hybrid of art, code, and AI positions me at the cutting edge of what creativity looks like in the modern age — not just building apps, but exploring how machines and humans collaborate to produce expressive work.
